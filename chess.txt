Project Title: Chess
Description: This is a playable chess game against a simple, programmed bot. The game should be able to:
Simulate the pieces as if they were in a real game of chess (rules of movement, taking pieces, etc.)
When a piece is selected to move, highlight playable moves
Have a bot that can simulate possible moves and assign a point system to figure out the “best move” possible according to the given parameters (what constitutes more/less points)
If possible, allow two-player functionality and/or a timer system

UML Diagram:


How does it work?
Start the program
If a two-player system is implemented, choose between playing against another player or a bot.
Start on white or black?
Click on a piece to select it
Click on a highlighted square to place the piece there, signaling the end of the turn
The bot will calculate the “best move” and move accordingly
Game ends in checkmate
